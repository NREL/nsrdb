.. inclusion-intro

The National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) software includes all the methods
for the irradiance data processing pipeline. To get started, check out the
NSRDB command line interface `(CLI) <https://nrel.github.io/nsrdb/_cli/nsrdb.html#nsrdb>`_.
Refer to the `NREL website
<https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/>`_ and the original `journal article
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211830087X>`_ for
more information on the NSRDB.  For details on NSRDB variable units, datatypes,
and attributes, see the `NSRDB variable meta data
<https://github.com/NREL/nsrdb/blob/master/config/nsrdb_vars.csv>`_.

The PXS All-Sky Irradiance Model
================================
The PXS All-Sky `Irradiance Model
<https://github.com/NREL/nsrdb/tree/master/nsrdb/all_sky>`_ is the main physics
package that calculates surface irradiance variables.

The NSRDB Data Model
====================
The NSRDB `Data Model
<https://github.com/NREL/nsrdb/tree/master/nsrdb/data_model>`_ is the data
aggregation framework that sources, processes, and prepares data for input to
All-Sky.

Installation
============

Option 1: Install from PIP (recommended for analysts):
------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new environment: ``conda create --name nsrdb python=3.9``

2. Activate environment: ``conda activate nsrdb``

3. Install nsrdb: ``pip install NREL-nsrdb``

Option 2: Clone repo (recommended for developers)
-------------------------------------------------

1. from home dir, ``git clone git@github.com:NREL/nsrdb.git``

2. Create ``nsrdb`` environment and install package
    1) Create a conda env: ``conda create -n nsrdb``
    2) Run the command: ``conda activate nsrdb``
    3) ``cd`` into the repo cloned in 1.
    4) Prior to running ``pip`` below, make sure the branch is correct (install
       from main!)
    5) Install ``nsrdb`` and its dependencies by running:
       ``pip install .`` (or ``pip install -e .`` if running a dev branch
       or working on the source code)
    7) *Optional*: Set up the pre-commit hooks with ``pip install pre-commit`` and ``pre-commit install``
