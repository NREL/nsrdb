# Welcome to the National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB)!
This repository contains all of the methods for the NSRDB data processing pipeline. 
You can read more about the NSRDB [here](https://nsrdb.nrel.gov/) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136403211830087X). 

## The PXS All-Sky Irradiance Model
The PXS All-Sky Irradiance Model is the main physics package that calculates surface irradiance variables. 
The code base and additional documentation can be found [here](https://github.nrel.gov/PXS/nsrdb/tree/master/nsrdb/all_sky).

## The NSRDB Data Model
The NSRDB Data Model is the data aggregation framework that sources, processes, and prepares data for input to All-Sky. 
The code base and additional documentation can be found [here](https://github.nrel.gov/PXS/nsrdb/tree/master/nsrdb/data_model).
